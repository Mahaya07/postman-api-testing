# Postman API Testing Project

## Description
This project demonstrates API testing using Postman on public REST APIs.

## APIs Tested
- GET Users API
- POST Create Post API

## Validations Performed
- Status code validation (200, 201)
- Request and response verification

## Evidence
Screenshots of API execution are available in the screenshots folder.

## Tools Used
- Postman
- JSONPlaceholder REST APIs
  
## 🤖 AI-Assisted API Testing Approach

Along with manual API testing using Postman, I use AI tools to strengthen my testing approach by:

- Generating additional positive and negative test scenarios
- Identifying missing validations in request headers and payloads

📄 Sample AI prompt and QA review:  
ai-prompts/api-test-scenario-generation.md

- Reviewing API responses to detect edge cases
- Improving clarity and structure of test documentation

AI is used as a support tool to enhance testing quality, while final test decisions and validations are performed manually.
